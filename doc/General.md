### Initial vowels & standard forms

In all lexical classes, it seems that initial vowels are sometimes euphonic ("tal-leħen"), yet other times they are part of the word.
This is likely an etymological issue, though no clear patterns emerge. We will use {DM} as the reference stick to that standard. Examples:

**Nouns**

- _mbuljuta_
- _mgħarfa_
- _mħadda_
- _mnieħer_
- _mqarrun_
- _nbid_
- _sbuħija_
- _spettur_
- _statistika_

But:

- _imbatt_
- _immaġinazzjoni_
- _impenn_
- _injam_
- _ispirazzjoni_
- _istitut_

**Semitic Verbs**

{MDG} gives verb conjugations **with** initial vowels: _insum, isum, inbierek, ibierek_ etc., 
but others ({DM}, {OM}, {GM}) seem to leave them out and give the standard form without the euphonic vowels: _nsum, jsum, nbierek, jbierek_ etc.

We will keep to the form **without** included vowels, since they are not part of the morphology and are really a syntactic phenomena.

**Loan Verbs**

- _mmatura_
- _kkopja_
- _pparkja_
- _nnervja_

But:

- _immaġina_
- _ikkoppja_ (he fished with a net)
- _ipponta_
- _innamra_

**Adjectives**

Similar situation as with nouns:

- _mħassar_
- _mxarrab_
- _rqiq_

But:

- _importanti_
- _inċert_
- _isfar_
