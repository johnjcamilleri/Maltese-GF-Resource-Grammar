# Maltese GF Resource Grammar: General

## Conventions

### Standard forms

**Nouns**
: Most nouns in {DM} are listed without any intial vowels, e.g. _nbid_ (and not _inbid_). However there are exceptions, e.g. _injam_.

**Verbs**
: {MDG} conjugates verbs with initial vowels, e.g. _insum, issum, isum, issum, insumu, issumu, isumu_ etc.
{GO} leaves out the vowels, e.g. _nsum, ssum, jsum, ssum, nsumu, ssumu, jsumu_ (note assimilation of _t_, which is another issue).
Currently the geminated treebank files have two versions, `.vowels.treebank` and `.treebank` respectively. Current feeling is that the standard form should **not** include vowels, but need to be sure we can add them when needed.

**Adjectives**
: e.g. _mÄ§assar, rqiq, mxarrab_ -- all found in {DM} without vowels. But: _importanti_. It seems to depend on the etymology of the word.
