### Standard forms

**Nouns**

Based on {DM}, in some nouns the initial "i" is part of the noun, and in others it is not. This is likely an etymological issue, but we will stick to that standard. Examples:

- _mbuljuta_
- _mgħarfa_
- _mħadda_
- _mnieħer_
- _mqarrun_
- _nbid_
- _sbuħija_
- _spettur_
- _statistika_

But:

- _imbatt_
- _immaġinazzjoni_
- _impenn_
- _injam_
- _ispirazzjoni_
- _istitut_

**Verbs**

{MDG} conjugates verbs with initial vowels: _insum, isum, inbierek, ibierek_ etc., 
but others seem to leave them out and give the standard form without the euphonic vowels: _nsum, jsum, nbierek, jbierek_ etc.

We will keep to the form **without** included vowels, since they are not part of the morphology.

**Adjectives**

Similar situation as with nouns:

- _mħassar_
- _mxarrab_
- _rqiq_

But:

- _importanti_
- _inċert_
- _isfar_
