Notes about the implementation of Maltese **nouns**.
This file is both a documentaion, as well as a to-do list.

## Overview

Note: NNQ = Non-numerically quantifiable

Nouns can have the following forms:
- Singular
  - Singulative (1, >10)
  - Collective (NNQ)
- Dual (2)
- Plural
  - Determinate (2-10)
  - Indeterminate (NNQ)
  - Sound
  - Broken
  - Plural of Plural

Typical combinations thereof  (* marks base form):
- Singulative, no plural!
- Singulative*, Plural
- Singulative* (1), Dual (2), Plural (>2)
- Singulative (1, >10), Collective* (NNQ), Determinate Plural (2-10)
- Singulative, Collective*, Determinate Plural, Indeterminate Plural -> very few nouns have these 4 forms
