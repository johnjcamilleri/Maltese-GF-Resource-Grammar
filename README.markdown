# Maltese GF Resource Grammar

This grammar is in early phases and will be updated very irregularly. The code is mirrored in at least two places:

1. At the official [GF repository][2] _(commits will always be compilable)_
1. On [GitHub][1] _(may contain interim code which doesn't compile)_

As far as I know, no one else has worked on a resource grammar for Maltese. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in contributing, or just curious.
