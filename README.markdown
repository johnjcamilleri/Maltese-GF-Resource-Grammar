# Maltese GF Resource Grammar Library

This is just my work-in-progress Maltese grammar for the [Grammatical Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/) Resource Grammar Library.
The grammar is still in early phases and this repository will change frequently with no real version numbers or anything;
I simply have this here as a versioned, off-site copy of my work in progress.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in contributing, or just curious.
